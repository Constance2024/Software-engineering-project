                                <h2>France</h2>
                                <p>You could spend a lifetime's worth of holidays in France and still feel as if you hadn't done the country justice. It remains one the planet's most visited tourist destination, meriting its standing with an almost overwhelming mass of historical treasures, storybook landscapes, and cultural idiosyncrasies.</p>
                                <p>The teeming glam of Paris makes for one hell of a centrepiece, matching any city on the planet for ambiance, individuality, and set-piece sights. But the real beauty of France, in many ways, lies elsewhere. The country's natural gifts are striking with white sandy beaches, hulking mountains and swathes of rolling countryside. It's a land that has inspired dreamers and drinkers, revolutionaries and artists.</p>
                                <p>&quot;How can one describe a country which has 246 kinds of cheese?&quot; once asked former French president Charles De Gaulle. Even today, it's a very good question.</p>

                                <p>Few places cram in as much scenery, history and culture as the United Kingdom. It&rsquo;s a busy, eccentric and unique destination; a land of daft humour, tea-and-cake clich&eacute;s and a thousand and one different personalities; a land where thrusting cities like London, Glasgow and Manchester share map space with the peaks of Snowdonia and the colossal slopes of the Highlands.</p>
                                <p>Four component nations make up the UK, and the end result is as many-layered as that fact would suggest. Its arts scene continues to be one of the most creative and successful in the world, its passions still run high on everything from politics to sport and its overall character is as modern as it is multicultural. Even the food&rsquo;s good these days.</p>
                                <p>As a country, of course, the UK&rsquo;s urban centres are just one part of its allure. Britain is often extremely beautiful.</p>

                                <p>From the soaring skyscrapers of New York City to the dramatic mesas of Arizona, the United States of America is a place of staggering beauty and extraordinary diversity. Nothing prepares you for your first glimpse of Manhattan&rsquo;s iconic skyline, the yawning expanses of the Grand Canyon or the neon-lit excesses of Las Vegas, just some of the country's many highlights.</p>
                                <p>You could easily spend a lifetime in the US and still feel like you&rsquo;ve just scratched the surface. It&rsquo;s epic on every scale. After all, this is a place where you can watch the thunderous spectacle of Niagara Falls, trek through the soaring Black Hills of South Dakota and cruise along California&rsquo;s glorious Pacific Coast; where you can ski at Lake Tahoe, go cattle ranching in the Midwest and imbibe live jazz in New Orleans. The options, it seems, are endless.</p>

                                <p>Travelling around Italy remains one of those rare experiences in life &ndash; like a perfect spring day or the power of first love &ndash; that can never be overrated. In few places do history, art, fashion, food and <em>la dolce vita</em> (&ldquo;the good life&rdquo;) intermingle so effortlessly. In Italy you'll find sunny isles, glacial lakes and fiery volcanoes, rolling vineyards and urban landscapes harbouring more UNESCO World Heritage sites than any other country on Earth. Few places offer such variety and few visitors leave without a fervent desire to return.</p>
                                <p>The artistic and architectural treasures of Rome, Venice, Florence and Naples draw visitors to them like moths to a flame. Not content with Romans conquering most of the known world, the Venetians dispatched Marco Polo to uncharted lands off the map, while Giotto, Leonardo da Vinci, Brunelleschi and Michelangelo kick-started the Renaissance in Western art and architecture.</p>

                                <p>Russia is at once breathtaking and baffling. Winston Churchill&rsquo;s much-quoted line that the world&rsquo;s largest nation represented &ldquo;a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma&rdquo; is as true today as it was back then.</p>
                                <p>Monumental in every respect, it&rsquo;s a land where burnished imperial splendour coexists with icy Siberian tundra, where timeworn Soviet-era monuments backdrop uber-hip urban cultures and where everything from the ruling party downwards functions in its own, impenetrably Russian, way. </p>
                                <p>A combination of the above is drawing an increasing number of tourists to the Russian Federation &ndash; that it remains as obscure and mysterious as ever is all part of the charm. As the poet Fyodor Tyutchev once said: &ldquo;Russia cannot be understood.&rdquo;</p>

                                <p>From kimono-clad geishas singing karaoke in Kyoto to Buddhist monks whizzing around Tokyo on motorbikes, Japan is a fascinating land of contrasts, a heady mix of tradition and modernity that often bewilders but never bores.</p>
                                <p>Nowhere in the world blends the old and new quite like Japan. The speed of new technological developments here is matched only by the longevity of its ancient customs and traditions. The country is a pioneer in the fields of design, technology, fashion and cuisine.</p>
                                <p>It is also a land of wild eccentricities, where you can watch men strip at the festival of Hadaka Matsuri and get amorous in one of the country&rsquo;s many short-stay love hotels. These facets might jar somewhat with Japan&rsquo;s polished image, but they help make it one of the most singular destinations on the planet.</p>

                                <p>From riotous fiestas and sizzling cuisine to world-class museums and cutting-edge art galleries, there's a reason why Spain endures as one of the world's most popular destinations. Like the country's famous tapas, Spain itself is a tempting smorgasbord of bustling cities, scenic countryside and sunny islands, which visitors can nibble away at on repeat trips or consume in one giant feast. Either way, it is one appetising nation.</p>
                                <p>And then there are the cities; Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao, Seville, Valencia, the list goes on. Each one of these vibrant metropolises has their own distinct flavour; the Dali architecture and sweeping beaches of Barcelona seem a long way from the wide boulevards and soaring skyscrapers of Madrid (though the Catalans may wish it was further).&nbsp;</p>

                                <p>Misunderstood by many, Germany is one of the most varied and charming countries on the continent. Anyone expecting a homogenous nation conforming to old Teutonic stereotypes is in for a shock.</p>
                                <p>As a destination, it offers a clutch of truly lovely cities, culture served up in hefty portions and rural scenery so pretty you'll wonder why it isn't on every tourist hit list.</p>
                                <p>It's no surprise, then, that today's Germany is more diverse and cosmopolitan than old stereotypes suggest; mixing time-honoured traditions with multicultural modernism and self-confidence.</p>
                                <p>It&rsquo;s the nation&rsquo;s urban highlights that immediately draw the attention. Berlin is the definition of dynamism, having forged a good-time reputation for groundbreaking creativity while still keeping sight of its past.</p>

                                <h2>Australia</h2>
                                <p>Australia is a land of savage beauty, big adventure and even bigger horizons. There are good reasons why the country finds itself touted as one of the ultimate travel getaways; it has personality in spades, landscapes to die for and more than its fair share of sunshine. And if beaches, rainforest and outback aren&rsquo;t your thing, then its major cities are outstanding destinations in their own right.</p>
                                <p>In many ways the country breeds extremes. The fiery atmosphere of an Aussie Rules match in Melbourne and the champagne glitz of Sydney Harbour belong to another planet entirely when compared to the quiet expanse of the Red Centre or the surf-bashed coastlines of the west.</p>
                                <p>A trip Down Under has long been synonymous with escape, exploration and adventure &ndash; an image that's unlikely to change anytime soon.</p>

                                <h2>Latvia</h2>
                                <p>Officially known as the Republic of Latvia, this small nation remained tucked behind the Iron Curtain until the early nineties. Today it is one of the most visited countries in the Baltics and lures visitors with its dramatic landscapes, rich heritage and vibrant capital, Riga.</p>
                                <p>Declared European Capital of Culture in 2014, the city has one of the most impressive collections of art nouveau buildings in the world, not to mention a stunning UNESCO World Heritage downtown. The old town is dominated by Riga Cathedral, the largest medieval church in the Baltics and one of many attractions in Riga vying for visitors&rsquo; attention.</p>
                                <p>While low cost air travel has opened Latvia to the masses, most visitors still struggle to venture beyond the capital. However, those who do find treasure in this country will, as the tourist board likes to say, discover it is &ldquo;best enjoyed slowly.&rdquo;</p>

                                <p>A small dot in the Atlantic between Scandinavia and America, Iceland has built an impressive tourist industry from its abundant natural wonders.</p>
                                <p>The fire in question, of course, comes from Iceland&rsquo;s abundant volcanoes, which burst periodically into life, with sometimes costly consequences for European aviation. Elemental forces bubble just below the surface across the island, heating the water in Iceland&rsquo;s taps and swimming pools, and creating otherworldly landscapes of twisted lava and rainbow-coloured mineral sands.</p>
                                <p>So come trek a lava-field, gaze on a glacier, spot a whale or a puffin, sample one of Europe&rsquo;s strangest national cuisines, and brave the snows in winter to glimpse the northern lights in their full glory, undimmed by light pollution in the least densely populated nation in Europe.</p>

                                <p>Canada&rsquo;s people are as varied as the landscapes; from the Arctic Indigenous peoples and the Francophone Quebeckers to the British expatriates and burgeoning Asian community, this is a multicultural land where around 22% of the population are foreign-born.</p>
                                <p>Canadian cities are progressive, vibrant and regularly feature on lists of &quot;best places to live&quot;. Toronto, a veritable patchwork of charming neighbourhoods, has an idyllic beachside location on the shore of Lake Ontario, while Canada&rsquo;s capital city, Ottawa, contains a clutch of fantastic museums and the gorgeous Rideau Canal for ice skating in winter. Montreal&rsquo;s skyscrapers belie its French heritage, but look closer and you can stumble upon historic, cobbled streets and centuries-old customs.</p>
                                <p>In Canada, the options are endless.</p>

                                <p>Underrated but increasingly popular, Poland offers a huge amount for travellers of all stripes &ndash; from the stunning old towns of Krakow, Zamość, Gdańsk and Wroclaw to the wilderness of the Białowieża National Park with its epic vistas.</p>
                                <p>Home to Europe&rsquo;s most infamous ghetto, Warsaw was almost totally destroyed during WWII, but the Polish capital is modernising fast. Today the city blends Soviet architecture and contemporary styles, with a painstakingly recreated old town and an upbeat, progressive population.</p>
                                <p>Perhaps the country's biggest draw, though, is Krakow. The country's former royal capital is a wonderfully preserved architectural marvel that has somehow managed to survive Poland&rsquo;s many wars. Even the Nazis thought it was too beautiful to bomb. Jam-packed with churches, monasteries and abbeys in Gothic and Renaissance styles, the city became the first ever UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1978.</p>

                                <p>From precipitous glaciers to steep-sided gorges and crystalline fjords, Norway&rsquo;s natural beauty is impossible to overstate. The unspoilt wilderness of the Arctic north is one of the few places where the sun shines at midnight during the summer and where the magnificent Northern Lights brighten the skies during the long winter nights.</p>
                                <p>Stunning though the cities are, the real wonders of Norway are to be found outdoors. In the far north, the glacier-covered sub-polar peninsular of Svalbard is one of the few areas where polar bears can be seen in the wild and Norway&rsquo;s miles of Arctic tundra double up as a destination for skiing and spotting the Northern Lights.</p>
                                <p>Elsewhere, you&rsquo;d be hard pushed to find a part of Norway&rsquo;s northern fjord area that isn&rsquo;t strikingly beautiful, with snow-capped peaks and looming forests almost everywhere you look.</p>

                                <p>Sweden is a land of incredible contrasts, from the dense pine forests and craggy mountains of the north, to the rolling hills and glossy golden beaches of the south. But the diversity doesn't stop at the suburbs, with each of Sweden's seven major cities boasting its own character, history and unique architectural style.</p>
                                <p>The instantly likeable capital Stockholm has long been synonymous with style and its sharply tailored brand of chic has percolated throughout the wardrobes of the world. Hipsters notwithstanding, Stockholm, with its 14 islands and medieval beauty, has much to offer those in search of culture, art and historical treasures. However, perhaps the most surprising city is Malmö, which has belied its unfairly grim reputation to become one of the country's liveliest destinations.</p>

                                <p>Finland is the big surprise of the Nordic countries, a natural wonderland with over 179,000 islands and more trees than people. With miles of empty wilderness, the Finns are uniquely in tune with their natural surroundings.</p>
                                <p>The culture of the Finns has been shaped by the historic tug-of-war between Sweden and Russia, leaving dotted enclaves such as Russian-tinted Karelia, and the Swedish-speaking regions of &Aring;land and Ostrobothnia. Even the Finnish language is an anomaly, curiously related to Hungarian.</p>
                                <p>For most, the gateway to Finland is Helsinki. A friendly and surprisingly small capital city, here historic churches rise above tidy public squares and stone wharfs are crowded with market traders and ferryboats. It&rsquo;s probably the best place to encounter Finland&rsquo;s famous party spirit, especially during the light nights of midsummer.</p>

The arctic nights in the winter concoct a wondrous continuous twilight. In the far north of the country, complete darkness is coupled with the spectacular Northern Lights during the coldest months. While Greenland may not be top of many travellers' bucket lists, where else can you visit such raw and unspoilt landscapes?</p>
                                <p>There are hardly any roads on the island, so expect to fork out for boat travel, or even helicopter journeys. The upshot is that glacial vistas, yawning fjords and soaring mountains are all there for the taking. Definitely bring a camera.</p>
                                <p>With transport options and tourism agencies having improved travelling conditions of late, there's never been a better time to visit Greenland.</p>

Fishing, jeep tours, horse and camel riding, mountain biking and birdwatching are but a few of the activities on offer. Intrepid visitors can also explore numerous temple ruins like Ma&ntilde;juśrī Monastery on the slopes of Bogd Khan Mountain or Ongi Monastery in the Dundgovi Province.</p>

                                <p>Although the cities are delightful, for many visitors the greatest allure of Cuba is its beaches. Christopher Columbus described the sandy coast of Guardalavaca as &quot;the most beautiful land that human eyes have ever seen,&quot; and you can see why he was so taken &ndash; the impossibly white sands and warm turquoise waters are exquisite.</p>
                                <p>While Cuba is still not an easy country to get your head around, its affable climate, captivating history, beautiful beaches and swinging salsa rhythms certainly reward those who visit and give it the time it deserves.</p>

                                <h2>Morocco</h2>
                                <p>Morocco is a heady mix of cultures, religions, ancient traditions, and modern sensibilities. It conjures up images of mint tea and tagine, date plantations and minarets, labyrinthine medinas and pungent spice stalls.</p>
                                <p>One of the more liberal countries in North Africa, Morocco&rsquo;s biggest drawing card is Marrakech, a giddying and grandiose city that Winston Churchill described as &ldquo;simply the nicest place on Earth to spend an afternoon.&rdquo; This sentiment rings true for many travellers today.</p>
                                <p>The epic waves of Western Sahara prove an adventure too far for most travellers. Government forces continue to occupy this disputed territory, even though Moroccan sovereignty is not recognised by the United Nations. The issue remains a sensitive subject.</p>

                                <p>Then there&rsquo;s the cuisine &ndash; one of the world&rsquo;s finest, and certainly one of the spiciest. From fine restaurants to street stalls and night markets, Thailand always seems to have a fork in its hand.&nbsp;Above all else, though, Thailand is a place to feel at ease &ndash; stroll along the sand, take tea with a monk, snorkel over a coral reef, and let the stresses of modern life slowly slip away.</p>

                                <p>Mexico today is a booming modern economy, led by its gargantuan capital, Mexico City. Once you adjust to the relentless pace of life in this metropolis, you can indulge in world-class museums, dine in exquisite restaurants, cut shapes in clubs and barter at sprawling markets. Beyond the modern cities, lie sleepy villages where age-old customs and ancient beliefs endure. Across the country, lively festivals reflect this blending of faiths, most famously at the Day of the Dead ceremony.</p>
                                <p>For visitors seeking outdoor adventure, Mexico delivers. Nature lovers can go whale watching in Baja California, reef diving off the Yucat&aacute;n Peninsula and trekking through the jungle to glowing blue lagoons bordering Guatemala.</p>

                                <p>In many ways, there are two Egypts. The first is the Egypt of Cairo and the Nile, of bustling medieval bazaars, noseless Sphinxes, river cruises and Agatha Christie-era exoticism.  The second, and just as integral to many visitors, is the Egypt of the Red Sea, where a spread of large-scale modern resorts caters to sun-seekers and scuba divers.</p>
                                <p>Most of the country&rsquo;s ancient treasures were built during the time of the pharaohs. The Pyramids of Giza (the sole survivors of the Seven Ancient Wonders of the World); the lotus-columned temples of Luxor and Karnak; the Valley of the Kings; Aswan and the temples of Abu Simbel: strung along the Nile, these monuments have drawn visitors for centuries. They represent a lasting legacy of one of the most fabled periods of human history.</p>

Both are home to an ever-growing spread of luxury accommodation, gourmet restaurants, branded nightclubs and gleaming shopping malls. Dubai&rsquo;s most iconic sights include the sail-shaped &ldquo;7-star&rdquo; hotel Burj Al Arab, the Burj Khalifa skyscraper and the sea-themed Atlantis Resort, which are microcosms of the UAE&rsquo;s lofty ambitions.</p>
                                <p>Abu Dhabi, meanwhile, doesn&rsquo;t have quite the same verve but boasts some remarkable attractions, from the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque to the Ferrari World theme park. Meanwhile, the vast natural desert offers endless discoveries via exciting modes of transport from hot air balloon and quad bike to helicopter or sandboard.</p>

                                <p>Chief among the attractions has to be the cyan-blue sea. As you enter the Fijian airspace you will no doubt be greeted with a carpet of glistening turquoise reefs, fringing unspoilt confetti of sandy, lush islands. It may look tranquil and majestic, but beneath the surface it's teeming with life. Amid multicoloured reefs, the intrepid can explore over 1,000 fish species. You'll also find five of the seven species of sea turtle as well as sharks, dolphins and whales around Fiji. You can't come here without snorkelling or diving at least some of the time.</p>

                                <p>The country&rsquo;s long, thin shape, sometimes compared to two rice baskets at either end of a pole, means these two cities form natural start and end points to an itinerary. The highlights along the way, meanwhile, are as well packed as the spring rolls which adorn market stalls: nature-lovers, history buffs, beach bums and foodies are all catered for in singularly Vietnamese style.</p>
                                <p>The US wartime legacy can still be readily explored &ndash; perhaps most notably at the Cu Chi Tunnels near Ho Chi Minh &ndash; but this is a country to enjoy for what it is today, whether you&rsquo;re here for a few days or a month.</p>

                                <p>Oman has an outwardly conservative, but strikingly open Islamic society, with a firm belief in the importance of its own traditions but a strong acceptance of other cultures. Many regard Oman as the most welcoming of all the Arabic nations; this is a place where foreigners are invited to sit and sip tea and eat dates out of genuine hospitality, rather than as a preamble to selling souvenirs.</p>
                                <p>More than anything though, Oman is a place to feel safe and at ease. The Omanis are gracious hosts, and visitors will find traditional Arabian hospitality and Islamic culture at its very best.</p>

                                <p>Many visitors come specifically to seek out their own island paradise, complete with white-sand beaches, swaying palms and emerald waters. Below the waters, there are some of the world's best dive sites, swarming with huge sunfish, giant rays, sharks, porpoises, turtles and a blindingly colourful array of tropical fish.</p>
                                <p>For others, the attraction is cultural. A fascinating range of civilisations has developed across these tropical islands, from animist tribes in remote jungle villages to the elaborate Hindu kingdoms of Bali and Java. In Indonesia, timeless temples jostle for space with golden-domed mosques.</p>

                                <p>From the jungle calls of the Amazon to the thong-clad crowds of Copacabana beach, Brazil is an intoxicating mix of the big, the bold and the beautiful, perennially one of the world&rsquo;s favourite destinations.</p>
                                <p>Its vast coastline is fringed with soft sands and island getaways; the Amazon Basin teems with an unrivalled mass of flora and fauna; and the wetlands of the Pantanal, the largest on Earth, support a staggering diversity of wildlife.</p>
                                <p>You can take life easy and let Brazil come to you by lolling in a hammock on an Amazonian ferry, looking out for the occasional macaw, or browsing the backstreets of colonial towns such as Ouro Preto and Paraty, which are lined with architectural monuments and chic boutique hotels.</p>
                                <p>Whatever you&rsquo;re looking for, rest assured, Brazil has it in spades.</p>

                                <p>South America doesn&rsquo;t get much more evocative of generations gone by than Peru. Its mix of ancient civilisations and dramatic archaeology, set among some of the most extraordinary landscapes on the planet, means few destinations have as much to offer cultural visitors.</p>
                                <p>The old Inca settlement of Machu Picchu, now said to be the most visited site on the entire continent, is just the poster-child &ndash; it&rsquo;s utterly magnificent, of course, but it&rsquo;s just one of many highlights served up by the country. From mountain range to jungle, beach to desert, colonial town to cosmopolitan city, it&rsquo;s a truly wonderful place to travel.</p>
                                <p>Elsewhere in the country, the Nazca Lines, the beautifully excavated ruins of Chan Chan and the Chachapoya fortress of Kuelap boggle the mind. These extraordinary complexes are all set amid stunning landscapes.</p>

While memories of a troubled past remain, the republic is well on the way to regaining its throne as the holiday capital of Africa, visited by nearly 10 million people every year.</p>
                                <p>Topping a long list of attractions is the republic&rsquo;s spectacular wildlife and natural scenery. National parks and nature reserves preserve an incredible variety of landscapes &ndash; rolling plains, towering mountains, arid deserts, coastal <em>fynbos</em> (shrubland) and pure blue oceans &ndash; home to an incredible variety of wildlife, from lions and elephants to great white sharks and playful penguins.</p>

                                <p>Combining expansive greenery, slick cities and bucketfuls of fresh air, Switzerland is a stylish tourist destination that offers countless outdoor adventures and contemporary urban breaks.</p>
                                <p>Switzerland&rsquo;s Alpine vistas are so picture perfect, they appear to have been plucked from a postcard or the pages of a storybook. But these disarming landscapes are alive and kicking, as the myriad spots for skiing, hiking or mountain biking can attest. Ski resorts like Zermatt (home to the lofty Matterhorn), Verbier and celebrity-studded St Moritz provide everything from big, bad Olympic runs to encouragingly gentle novice slopes. And when the snow melts at low altitudes, the white-tipped mountain peaks remain against a backdrop of blue skies, providing a superb setting for summertime hiking.</p>

                                <p>Split into two main landmasses &ndash; the North and South Islands &ndash;New Zealand is a deceptively diverse and complicated destination that rewards both first-time and repeat visitors. The North Island is less visually dramatic than its southern counterpart, but it is home to around two thirds of the country&rsquo;s inhabitants. The majority of the major urban centres are here, including the capital, Wellington, and the increasingly dynamic city of Auckland. But nature is still a major player, thanks to volcanoes, thermal regions and the magnificent Bay of Islands.</p>
                                <p>New Zealand has also developed into one of the cleanest and greenest countries in the world. There are 14 national parks throughout the country and almost a quarter of New Zealand is protected land. What else? There&rsquo;s wildlife, wine and a cultural resurgence that&rsquo;s seeing local films, literature and art gaining more and more attention.</p>

                                <p>Spirited Argentina, with its clamouring capital, vast pampas, rolling wine regions and snowy peaks, is a land bursting with adventure. It&rsquo;s a place where the clich&eacute;s hold true: football is essentially a religion, the beef is phenomenal and there&rsquo;s little point even thinking about starting a proper night out before midnight. Its natural wonders range from Andean plateaux and Patagonian glaciers to subtropical waterfalls and wildlife-rich wetlands. There&rsquo;s an awful lot to love.</p>
                                <p>Try walking in the glistening Lake District, whale-watching off the coast at Puerto Madryn, meeting baby penguins in Punta Tombo or exploring the Jesuit chapels and farmhouses of C&oacute;rdoba. Another of the country&rsquo;s majestic natural beauties is the mighty Iguazu Falls, bordering Argentina and Brazil.&nbsp;</p>

                                <p>Occupying a stunning stretch of the Adriatic coastline, Croatia is one of Europe's top seaside destinations. Boasting more than 1,100 islands, the country is renowned for its limpid waters and picture-perfect scenery.</p>
                                <p>But Croatia is much more than sea and sunshine &ndash; it&rsquo;s home to historic walled cities and spectacular Roman ruins, as well as imposing castles and unspoiled national parks. The fantastic cuisine, including seafood on the coast and truffles in Istria, fine wines and buzzing caf&eacute; culture add to the appeal.</p>
                                <p>Beyond the tourist zones, Croatia is full of isolated places where you can discover more traditional, local life. Head to Plitvice for its amazing, lake-strewn national park, or explore the rugged mountain ranges of Velebit and Gorski Kotar, havens for hiking.</p>

                                <p>Colossal, dizzying and fiercely foreign, China isn&rsquo;t easily compared to anywhere else on the planet. Home to approximately one fifth of the human race, it variously dazzles, befuddles, frustrates and thrills. The key visitor attractions are renowned around the globe &ndash; think the Great Wall, the Forbidden City, and the Terracotta Warriors &ndash; but it&rsquo;s the sheer scale and off-kilter energy of the place that leave the most lasting impression.</p>
                                <p>Shift away from the urban sprawl and out into China&rsquo;s rural areas, however, and you&rsquo;re confronted with a very different reality. The scenery veers from lush terraced rice paddies and the harsh peaks of the Himalayas to the gorges of the UNESCO-protected Yangtze River. In some of the rural heartlands, indeed, the tableau of life can seem little changed from 50 years ago, at least on the surface. China is full of endless quirks and contradictions, but that&rsquo;s half the charm.</p>

                                <p>As flat as a local <em>pannenkoek</em>, the Netherlands is a land of colourful tulip fields and canals, sophisticated cities and some of the most striking coastline in Northern Europe. It punches well above its weight culturally, laying claim to the likes of Van Gogh, Rembrandt and Mondrian, amongst others.</p>
                                <p>At the head of the state sits the country's constitutional monarchy, whose palaces dominate many of the larger cities, including The Hague and the capital city, Amsterdam. The latter, renowned for its step-gabled houses, ubiquitous bikes, seedy red light district and hazy coffeeshops, is bisected by a UNESCO-listed network of waterways, many of which are spanned by beautiful, latticed bridges.</p>
                                <p>Best of all though, are the sandy, North Sea beaches of Zeeland, which stretch for an almost unbroken 650km (403-miles). With more sunshine than any other part of the Netherlands, Zeeland is the Dutch riposte to the Caribbean &ndash; and with better cycling trails and museums, if not the hot weather, to boot.</p>

                                <p>This is a nation whose capital, Budapest, can hold up a mirror to classical Vienna; it&rsquo;s a world of well-preserved castles, seductively good wines and quiet stoic pride; a landscape of low-lying mountains, oak forests and thermal springs.</p>
                                <p>The Romans were the first to make use of the hot waters, originally for medicinal purposes. Today, the pursuit is relaxation and over time the bathhouses have grown into splendid architectural affairs, most notably in Budapest.</p>
                                <p>The capital is an elegant, stylish and lively city made up of two separate settlements clustered on either side of the Danube River: hilly Buda has a wealth of graceful Habsburg and neoclassical buildings, while sprawling Pest is its commercial centre with a generous scattering of art nouveau architecture and an ad-hoc party scene.</p>
